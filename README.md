# Music App using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer

Ive always wanted to create a music app so I decided to teach myself.
I designed the UI myself although it could use improvements.
This app is still in a very early stage.
This music app can play, pause, and stop five songs.
Ultimately I wanted to get the functionality running first then make a sleek UI.
Hope you Enjoy!
